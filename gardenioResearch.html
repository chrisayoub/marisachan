            <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
            <p>Our product consists of both a physical product and a mobile application, so we brainstormed two independent user tests to collect information for each product. This would help maximize our ability to improve both of the experiences for our users. We wanted to discover what users believed to be most helpful while gardening and what they thought would lead them to highest success.</p>

            <h1>Research Design: The Box</h1>
            <p>Our physical product is to be delivered to customers in a box and contains: three seedling pants of the buyer's choice, soil, compost, pots, and papers explaining how to care for the specific plants that were bought. We wrote up a plan to assess user interaction with the products and to gather their thoughts and opinions of how the box was organized, because we decided that user experiences with our product should be positive from the first moment they interact with it.</p>

            <h1>Research Design: The App</h1>
            <p>Our accompanying mobile application allows users to browse our database of plant information to find how to care for their garden. We created an interview plan to have users complete simple tasks of finding information within the app while we observe their verbal thought processes and nonverbal behaviors. We hoped that testing our mobile app could provide us with immediate feedback in how to improve the application.</p>

            <h1>Research Design: The Survey</h1>
            <p>As another source of gathering user data, we created a survey that listed out characteristics of gardening and the types of information gardeners believed to be helpful. Users had to rank what they believed was most to least important in gardening. We decided to create this survey as a supplemental form of deciding what types of information our mobile application would most benefit from, and highlight key features users felt were important to them.</p>

            <h1>Execution</h1>
            <p>The other UX researchers and I felt that it was important for users to easily interact with our products, so we placed them on a table for people to fully engage with the box. We had open laptops and took notes during each individual interview and followed our procedural script to keep questions consistent with all users. Each researcher was tasked with one product to assess: One person with the box, one person with the mobile application, and one person with the survey. People would move from one researcher to the next after completing each interview.</p>

        <div class="col-6">
            <h1>Feedback</h1>
            <p>Our team was able to collect valuable feedback from each interview we conducted. Based on user feedback, we discovered that our box product does not present the seedlings plants as the main asset of the box, but rather the pots due to their large size. We also learned that our mobile application had a number of discrepancies for users trying to discover information. They expressed confusion while navigating and believed that certain pieces of information should have belong in other sections of the app. Luckily, I was able to create pivot tables out of the feedback from the completed surveys and discovered that most users want plant information based on their geographical location.</p>

            <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <h1>Thoughts &amp; Next Steps</h1>
            <p>A setback we encountered prior to the interviews was the uncontrolled environment we conducted our testing in due to user access to alcohol. We had to overcome that problem by gauging the sobriety of our users as they interacted with our product and app. Another issue we had to overcome was the unconventional setting of conducting user testing at a backyard product reveal party. These factors played a role in how we collected our data in addition to analyzing our results. However, we were able to collect helpful information that will improve our product and allow us to take a deeper look into how our mobile application can be more usable.</p>
